# Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed sales performance by combining and examining the Orders.csv and Details.csv datasets. By evaluating key metrics such as total sales, profitability, and order quantity, we identified the most (and least) successful product categories and sub-categories.

The analysis also highlighted key geographical markets by revealing sales performance by state and city. Furthermore, we gained insight into customer preferences by identifying the most commonly used payment methods.

The final dashboard (image.png) visually summarizes these findings, providing a clear and actionable overview of the business's performance. These insights can be used to make data-driven decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategy, and regional sales focus.
